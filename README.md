# my-fair-fight

A quick backstory of the project: 

I started karate 17 years ago, and a couple of years back I joined an organisation called FairFight. It aims to empower young girls from underpriviledged communities with the mental and physical benefits of martial arts. We find a karate instructor from the same community and talk to local schools to get them to offer karate lessons as one of their taught sports.

The girls from both our projects in India and Zimbabwe always look so motivated and happy to train when we're there. I wanted to find a way to make sure they stayed motivated, while also helping us track what was happening there. 

My Fair Fight is a mativating app, where the girls keep track of their progress by posting comments and photos of what they achieved, and where they can received achievement "badges" or "stickers" from their instructor at different types of milestones. 

You can access the app as 3 different types of users:
- A student: you have to precise your age, the country, city and school you are from. You can then access your timeline and your profile.
- A teacher: you have to precise the country you are from so we can match you with the relevant students. You can then access your achievement sending page.
- An admin: as an admin, you can add and delete ongoing projects that will impact what country, city and school the students can choose from when registering. You also have the admin power to delete users. All admin activity is saved and logged on your profile to keep track of what you have done and what the other admins have done. 

In the future, I would like to add:
- The option for admins to see all student's and teacher's pages
- A page that would show the admins stats of the ongoing projects: number of students per school, increase in belt color throughout time, etc.
